# Smart-OTP-Based-Locker
We are going to develop a smart locker that will have a three-tier security system for excess
safety. There will be three locks and each of them secured by a different type of sensor. The top
will be secured using face recognition, the middle one will be a passcode that will be sent in the
form of OTP on the registered mobile number and the bottom one will be a fingerprint sensor.
Using the ESP 32 camera we are going to use face detection and face recognition, using GSM
SIM800l we are going to send the OTP to the registered mobile number. We have set up a
database for multiple users so that OTP can be sent to that specific person. The real-time
database is made on firebase and it will have user code and mobile number. So the person will
have to first enter the user code then the OTP will be sent. And if anyone tries to break any of
these safety locks, the buzzer will be initiated. The last security is a fingerprint sensor. So, a
fingerprint is highly specific and is safer. The basic idea of this research paper is to highly
increase security and make use of biometrics as a security policy because they are highly specific
and it is really difficult to crack them.
